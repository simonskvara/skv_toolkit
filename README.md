# Game A Week toolkit 

This is a package with useful stuff for fast development for the course Game A Week.

Documentation of what I did will be in the changelog.

## !!! Important !!!

Install the sample Loading Screen. It was put in as a sample so the loading screen can be modified.

## Instructions to some stuff

- Scene preview
  - Create a prefab with a Camera in it, add a PreviewCamera and add the generator script to it
  - Place a camera in a scene with a tag PreviewCamera and when the scene is saved, it saves the camera view as a sprite
  - LevelButton script takes the sprite and can showcase it in an image
